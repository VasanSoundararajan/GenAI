    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Safety Checking**:\n",
    "   - Must check each bank separately\n",
    "   - Must first check if farmer is present\n",
    "   - Only check dangerous combinations if farmer is absent\n",

    "   - Shows exact contents of each bank\n",
    "   - Shows farmer's location\n",
    "   - No ambiguous terms\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strict Move Validation**:\n",
    "   - Must list all possible moves\n",
    "   - Must explain choice\n",
    "   - Must verify safety after move\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Proper Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - Must identify specific rule violation\n",
    "   - Must return to previous safe state\n",
    "   - Must try different move"
